Increased SEO through links back
Your content no longer competing against itself in search traffic from appearing on other websites
Additional traffic to your website from click-throughs
Ad revenue from traveling ad tags contained within each 3rd party embed
 
<strong>Here's what Embed Article Technology does:</strong>
-          Gives others the ability to embed a portion (eg: first 150 words) of your articles onto their own website or blog
-          All embedded articles are rendered out using Java Script so that they are invisible to search engines, rather than competing for traffic
-          Your article gets a link back to increase both traffic to your site & your articles' SEO value, along with reporting and control over where it ends up
-     You can earn additional ad revenue via the traveling ad space contained within embeds. Use your ad network of choice, or even use the ad space to promote your own website.

<strong>Reporting:</strong>
Embed Article let's you see what websites are embedding which articles, and how many impressions those articles are receiving. You'll also have the ability to remove unwanted embeds with just a click.
